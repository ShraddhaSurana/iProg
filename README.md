Interactive Structured Inducxtion of Programs for program synthesis
We propose the design of an interactive form of structured inductive programming in which a software engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an end-to-end solution for a problem. We use a variant of the ‘2-way Intelligibility’ protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM. A key feature of the protocol is that interaction (usually) terminates only when the software engineer ratifies the output of the LLM. We introduce two interactive procedures: iCode, which attempts to identify acceptable code, given a decomposition of the problem into sub-problems; and iStruc, which attempts to identify an acceptable decomposition of a problem from its description in natural language. Interactive structured inductive programming is taken to mean the sequential composition of iCode after iStruc. Both iCode and iStruc are implemented within the iProg tool for structured inductive programming.
